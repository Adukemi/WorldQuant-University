# WorldQuant-University-Data-Science-projects


I have completed a 16-week Applied Data Science Lab module at WorldQuant University, working on eight end-to-end applied data science projects. These mini-projects covered areas such as scientific computing, data wrangling, machine learning, and natural language processing using Python.

## Project Highlights
1. Housing in Mexico – Analyzed a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine whether real estate prices are more influenced by property size or location. Imported and cleaned data from a CSV file, created visualizations, and examined variable relationships using correlation analysis.

2. Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires – Developed a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina. Built a data pipeline for handling missing values and encoding categorical features, then optimized model performance by reducing overfitting.

3. Air Quality in Nairobi – Designed an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya. Extracted data from a MongoDB database using pymongo and enhanced model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.

4. Earthquake Damage in Nepal – Constructed logistic regression and decision tree models to predict building damage after an earthquake. Retrieved data from a SQLite database and identified biases in the dataset that could lead to discriminatory outcomes.

5. Bankruptcy in Poland – Implemented random forest and gradient boosting models to predict corporate bankruptcy. Worked with the Linux command line, addressed class imbalance through resampling, and evaluated model performance using precision and recall metrics.

6. Customer Segmentation in the US – Built a k-means clustering model to segment US consumers into distinct groups. Used principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and created an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash.

7. A/B Testing at WorldQuant University – Conducted a chi-square test to assess whether email campaigns influence program enrollment at WQU. Developed custom Python classes for an ETL process and built an interactive data application using a three-tiered design pattern.

8. Volatility Forecasting in India – Created a GARCH time-series model to forecast asset volatility. Collected stock market data via an API, processed and stored it in a SQLite database, and built an API to serve model predictions.

Note: Due to copyright restrictions, the projects code will not be uploaded.
